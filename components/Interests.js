            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy building computers, maintaining productivity, and exploring the Star Wars universe. I also have a passion for coffee and find that long scenic walks often inspire me to brainstorm new ideas. I also have a keen interest in traveling and would love to see Japan in particular.</p>
